# 👁️ EyeSpy

EyeSpy is a fun, fast-paced color perception game that challenges how sharp your eyes really are.  
Each round presents a grid of colored tiles — only one is slightly different.  
Spot it before you run out of lives.

## 🎮 How to Play
1. Click the tile that looks *just a little* different in color.  
2. Each correct answer earns a point and makes the colors blend closer.  
3. You start with 1 life — lose it if you choose wrong.  
4. See how high you can score before it gets too tricky.
